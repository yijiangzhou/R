This folder contains the MATLAB program that solves combinatorial discrete choice problem (CDC), based on the method in Arkolakis and Eckert (2017). 

To implement this program, download all files in this folder and run "CDC_main.m" in MATLAB. 

Please refer to "Notes on Code.pdf" if you have any difficulty understanding the codes.
