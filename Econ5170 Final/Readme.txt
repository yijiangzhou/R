
VFI_finite.m does backward induction and simulation and calls all the functions.

solveforc1.m is a function to solve for c_(T-1)^*.

solveforc2.m is a function to solve for c_(T-m)^* for all 2≤m≤T-1.

discountv.m is a function to calculate E{V_(T-m)}.

cornersolution.m is a function to solve for corner solution when there’s no positive real roots for c^*.

We also include 3 datasets: 
Q1ab.mat is the result dataset for Q1 a and b. 
Q1c.mat is for Q1 c. 
Q1d.mat is for Q1 d.

All figures are attached in the final report. They can also be found in the "Figures" folder.
